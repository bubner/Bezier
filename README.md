# Bézier Curves
###### https://serve.bubner.me/unity/bezier
This small Unity app generates Bézier curves using the explicit definition of summated binomial coefficients and linear interpolation. Created as a proof-of-concept and for fun to learn more about the math involved in computer graphics.

_Bézier curve general definition_

## Features
- Add up to 171 points (`double` datatype precision)
- Remove individual or all points
- Edit points and reflect changes dynamically and instantly (like Desmos)

### TODO
- Fix up some strange LineRenderer behaviour
- Slider/animation for interpolation ratio t
- Resolution adjustment
- Drawpoint construction lines (as per resolution)
- Coordinate plane
